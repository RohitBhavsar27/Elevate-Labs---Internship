# Python Calculator CLI
A simple command-line interface (CLI) calculator that allows you to perform basic mathematical calculations without the need for a graphical user interface. This calculator CLI provides a convenient way to perform calculations directly from your command prompt or terminal.

## Features
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
- Handles both integer and floating-point numbers.
- Provides a clear and concise output of the calculated result.

## Implementation Overview
- Structured the calculator using modular Python functions for each arithmetic operation: add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide().
- Implemented input handling using input() to prompt the user for operation choices and numerical values.
- Added a loop mechanism to allow continuous calculations until the user chooses to exit.
- Handled invalid inputs and division-by-zero scenarios with clear error messages.
- Maintained a clean CLI experience with intuitive prompts and well-formatted output.
