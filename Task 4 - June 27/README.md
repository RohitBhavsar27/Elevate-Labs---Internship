# User Management REST API
A Flask-based RESTful API application that enables users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on user data using in-memory storage. Built as part of a backend development task to demonstrate core API development skills.

## Features
- User Creation: Add new users using JSON-based POST requests.
- User Retrieval: Fetch individual users or get all users via GET requests.
- User Update: Modify existing user records with PUT requests.
- User Deletion: Remove users with a DELETE request.
- JSON Format: All data exchanged in clean, structured JSON format.
- Test-Friendly: Fully testable with Postman or Curl.

## Implementation Overview
- Framework: Uses Flask to define RESTful routes.
- Data Handling: Stores users in a Python dictionary as in-memory storage.
- API Endpoints: Supports standard HTTP methods on /users and /users/<id>
- Error Handling: Returns appropriate status codes like 200, 201, and 404.
- Modular Structure: Encapsulated logic with Flaskâ€™s routing decorators.
- Debug Mode: Runs with debug=True for quick iteration during development.


## Execution

   ```https://github.com/RohitBhavsar27/Elevate-Labs-Internship.git```

   ```cd Task 4 - June 27```


2. Create a virtual environment and install Flask.

    ```
    python -m venv venv  
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
